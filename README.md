This is a program which simulates Conway's Game of Life (see the Wikipedia page for details).  
After running the program, the initial game board is to be set by the user. Dead cells are represented by '.', while alive cells are represented by 'O'.  
Memory taken by the grid is dynamically managed, but once the first row is defined, each subsequent row must have the same number of cells (i.e. the end grid must be a rectangle with n rows and m columns).  
When the user is finished defining the starting grid, 'x' must be written to indicate all rows have been defined.  
Then, the user can type 'p' to print the current grid or 's' to step the grid.
The program will end once EOF is reached (Ctrl+D) or when terminated (Ctrl+C).
